## Overview

This is a full-stack web application built with React frontend and Express.js backend, featuring a PayPal-themed payment acceptance interface. The application uses TypeScript throughout, shadcn/ui for component library, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Drizzle ORM for database operations.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens matching PayPal's brand colors
- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom configuration for development and production

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL session store (connect-pg-simple)
- **Development**: Hot reload with tsx
- **Production**: ESBuild bundling for Node.js

```

## Key Components

### Database Layer
- **ORM**: Drizzle with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Schema Location**: `shared/schema.ts` for type sharing between frontend and backend
- **Connection**: Neon Database serverless connection
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-based session management

### Authentication & Sessions
- **Strategy**: Session-based authentication using PostgreSQL store
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer with MemStorage fallback for development
- **User Management**: Basic user CRUD operations with username/password

### UI Components
- **Design System**: shadcn/ui with "new-york" style variant
- **Theming**: CSS custom properties for PayPal brand colors
- **Typography**: Custom font definitions for PayPal-specific text styles
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach with custom breakpoints

### API Architecture
- **Prefix**: All API routes use `/api` prefix
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error middleware with status code mapping
- **Logging**: Request/response logging for API endpoints
- **CORS**: Configured for cross-origin requests with credentials

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: Frontend makes API calls using TanStack Query
2. **API Processing**: Express routes handle business logic using storage interface
3. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM executes PostgreSQL queries
4. **Response Handling**: JSON responses with proper error handling
5. **State Updates**: TanStack Query manages cache invalidation and updates

## External Dependencies

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Frontend build tool with React plugin
- **ESBuild**: Backend bundling for production
- **TypeScript**: Type checking across the entire stack
- **Replit Integration**: Custom plugins for development environment

### UI Libraries
- **Radix UI**: Headless component primitives
- **Lucide React**: Icon library
- **Embla Carousel**: Carousel functionality
- **date-fns**: Date manipulation utilities

### Backend Libraries

- **Express Session**: Session management
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Command**: `npm run dev`
- **Hot Reload**: Both frontend and backend with file watching
- **Database**: Uses DATABASE_URL environment variable
- **Vite Integration**: Custom middleware for serving React app

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: `vite build` outputs to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: ESBuild bundles to `dist/index.js`
- **Static Serving**: Express serves built frontend assets
- **Database Migrations**: `npm run db:push` for schema updates

### Environment Configuration
- **DATABASE_URL**: Required for PostgreSQL connection
- **NODE_ENV**: Controls development vs production behavior
